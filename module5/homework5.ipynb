    "Using data from the whole season, create a time series plot of cumulative sublimation with two lines, one using measured values and one using modeled values. Describe how the measured and modeled total sublimation differs. Note that latent heat flux is approximately equal to the sublimation rate. Latent heat flux, in units of g/m^2/s, when summed over the season, should be converted to g/m^2. That means you need to multiply each time step by the number of seconds in that timestep, to convert the latent heat flux (aka sublimation rate) into a total amount of water sublimated. So a 30-minute flux (units g/m^2/s) is multipled by 1800s (number of seconds in 30 minutes), to produce a measure of \"total sublimation in this 30-minute period\", in units g/m^2."
