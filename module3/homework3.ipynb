    "At Kettle Ponds, a dedicated instrument for measuring surface temperature (an Apogee infrared radiometer) is used to measure surface temperature (see variables Tsurf_c, Tsurf_d, Tsurf_ue, Tsurf_uw). One could also estimate surface temperature using the broadband longwave radiometers (which measure more than just infrared wavelengths, see variable Rlw_out_9m_d). Use broadband longwave radiometer meausrements of outgoing longwave radiation (Rlw_out_9m_d) to estimate snow surface temperature using the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. For 3-7 days during any time in the dataset, plot your estimate of surface temperature along with the Apogee infrared radiometer estimate. Discuss how they differ and why they might differ."

This is a result both of the rounding and growing of snow grains as well as the \"dirtying\" of snow through the deposition of atmospheric deposition particulates. In April, 2024, a substantial amount of dust was deposited on our site at Kettle Ponds (see the photo at the top of this page). Calculate and plot albedo during April the first half of April and identify the date on which you think dust was deposited. Explain how you come to this conclusion.\n",
